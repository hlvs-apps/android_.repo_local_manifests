How To Build CyanogenMod Android for Samsung Galaxy Tab 4 7.0 (T235[Y])
===========================================================================

CyanogenMod provides "How to build" instructions for some devices. Although this device is not officially supported,
the build-steps are not that different between devices. Most of the information on this page also apply to this device: 
http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/w/Build_for_t0lte

Requirements:
* At least 8GB RAM (build will stop without a warning with 6GB)
* 65GB (sources and build results) + 35GB (CCACHE)

Perform the following steps from the above "How to build":
1. Install the SDK
2. Install the Build Packages

3. Create the directories
  $ mkdir -p ~/bin
  $ mkdir -p ~/android/system

  Note: you can replace the build root "~/android/system" with any directory you like. 
  Let's assume it is "~/android/system" in the following steps.
  
4. Install the repo command
  $ curl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo
  $ chmod a+x ~/bin/repo

5. Put the ~/bin directory in your path of execution

6. Initialize the CyanogenMod source repository
  Here you have to replace "cm-12.0" with "cm-13.0":
    $ cd ~/android/system/
    $ repo init -u https://github.com/CyanogenMod/android.git -b cm-13.0

7. Download the source code
  $ repo sync

8. Patch sources
8.1. Copy local manifest from this patcher repository to the CM build directory and fetch device specific sources:
  $ cd ~/android/system/
  $ cp <patcher-dir>/roomservice.xml .repo/local_manifests/
  $ repo sync
8.2. Apply device specific patches (execute commands from build root):
  $ <patcher-dir>/setup.sh 

9. Prepare the device-specific code
  This step is device specific and hence different from the "How to build".
  
  $ source build/envsetup.sh
  $ lunch cm_degaslte-userdebug

  These commands only have a temporary effect, you will have to perform these commands again, 
  when you use a new terminal window.
  
10. Turn on caching to speed up build
  Only if you want to rebuilt CM multiple times you also should enable CCACHE

11. Start the build
  $ croot
  $ mka bacon

===========================================================================
# Build-results:
===========================================================================

The build-process takes a lot of time - the initial build can take about 10h. If CCACHE is enabled, 
the next builds only take 3-4 hours.
Note that especially the linking process (ld) needs a huge amount of memory. The building process stops
without a warning if only 6GB are present. In this case you can try to build with only one process (mka bacon -j1).

When the build-process finished the following files will be available:
  CyanogenMod image: out/target/product/degaslte/cm-13.0-<date>-UNOFFICIAL-<device>.zip
  recovery: out/target/product/degaslte/recovery.img

===========================================================================
# Rebuild:
===========================================================================

If you want to rebuild the ROM, perform the following steps:
  $ repo sync
  $ mka clean
  $ mka bacon

"repo sync" might fail due to local source code modifications. In this case temporarily revert the changes and 
reapply them after the update:
  $ repo sync (-> fails due to local modifications, failing subprojects are listed in log-output)
  * for each failing subproject, save and revert changes:
    $ cd <subproject-dir>
    $ git stash
  $ croot
  $ repo sync
  * for each previously failing subproject, reapply changes:
    $ cd <subproject-dir>
    $ git stash pop

===========================================================================
# Recovery:
===========================================================================

By default only a simple recovery is built with CM. If you want to build TWRP recovery instead, replace the directory "bootable/recovery"
with the source of TWRP:
  $ cd bootable
  $ mv recovery recovery.orig
  $ git clone -b android-6.0 https://github.com/omnirom/android_bootable_recovery recovery.twrp
  $ ln -s recovery.twrp recovery
  
Now make a clean build (see aboce) and the TWRP recovery should be available as
  out/target/product/degaslte/recovery.img

Note that updating with "repo sync" will fail now. Before you update, temporarily replace TWRP recovery with the original recovery:
  $ cd bootable
  $ rm recovery
  $ ln -s recovery.orig recovery
  $ croot
  $ repo sync
  $ cd bootable
  $ rm recovery
  $ ln -s recovery.twrp recovery
